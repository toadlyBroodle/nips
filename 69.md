# Zap Poll event

`draft` `optional` `author:toadlyBroodle`

A zap poll note is a [nostr event](01.md) (kind `6969`) for conducting paid pollsâ€”herein referred to simply as 'polls'. A poll presents two or more voting options, which participants my vote on by sending regular [zap events](57.md) which include an additional `poll_option` vote tag. Polls may include multiple recipients which participants may choose from when zapping their votes. Polls may specify `value_maximum` and `value_minimum` satoshi valuations for determining which zaps are included in the tally. Polls may specify a `consensus_threshold` for assessing the state of consensus. Polls should specify a `closed_at` time, after which results be unblinded, closed to new votes, and the tally considered final.

## Purpose

The purpose of poll notes is to conduct quantitative public opinion polls over nostr by requiring voters pay to participate. By tying results to real satoshi valuations, nostr polls intend to provide superior signal compared to other free polling models. Imposing real monetary costs for participation should also discourage undesired attempts to sway results.

Pollers may specify multiple `p` keys, to allow participants to choose which recipient they zap, regardless of their vote choice. The option for such distribution of funds should also incentivize participation by increasing voter optionality, poller authenticity, and legitimacy of results by mitigating certain unauthentic attack vectors.

By including a `value_maximum` limit, polls can stop single 'whale' votes discounting many smaller 'shrimp' votes. Likewise, by including a `value_minimum` limit, polls can make automated low-value vote flooding attacks prohibitively expensive. However, both limits remain optional to allow for freedom in poll design.

By setting `value_maximum` and `value_minimum` equal, a more traditional style poll may be designed, which weights each vote equal and limits each participant to a single vote.

The optional `consensus_threshold` is intended as a simple 'measuring bar', defined as the minimum percentage for any single `poll_option`'s percentage of the total tally to attain poll consensus status.

A careful balancing of all poll attributes should enable pollers to conduct tailored polls that deliver meaningful and valuable outcomes.

## Zap poll format

A poll event:
* MUST specify 1 or more `p` tags, each including the same primary hosting relay
* if an `e` tag is specified, it:
  * MUST include the same primary hosting relay URL as the `p` tags
* MUST contain a primary description string, specified in the `content` field
* MUST contain at least 2 `poll_option` tags, each specifying an index and a unique description string, formatted as below
* SHOULD specify a `closed_at` time:
  * when specified, MUST include a valid [`ots` tag](03.md), proving original poll publishing time
  * a `closed_at` value of null or less than or equal to the `created_at` field indicates a poll SHOULD NOT be closed.
* MAY specify a `value_maximum` satoshi value for zapped votes to be included in the tally
* MAY specify a `value_minimum` satoshi value for zapped votes to be included in the tally
  * `value_minimum` MUST be less than or equal to `value_maximum`, when both are specified
* MAY include a `consensus_threshold` (0-100), representing a percentage threshold for any single vote option to achieve poll consensus
  * a `consensus_threshold` of '0' indicates no threshold is specified.

## Zap voting

Poll options are voted on by sending [zap events](57.md) (referencing the original poll event's `e` and `p` values) that indicate their chosen vote option in a `poll_option` tag. To ensure all eligible votes are included in the tally, all `e` and `p` tags must specify the same primary hosting relay.

A voting client:
* SHOULD NOT allow submission of zap events with amounts greater than `value_maximum` (when specified)
* SHOULD NOT allow submission of zap events with amounts less than `value_minimum` (when specified) 
* SHOULD NOT allow submission of zap events after `closed_at` time (when specified)
* SHOULD NOT allow poll author to vote on their own polls
* SHOULD hide tally results, until after a user has zapped the note

## Zap vote format

The zap request event (kind `9734`): 
* MUST specify an `e` tag that references the original poll event
  * MUST include a primary hosting relay URL in the `e` tag
* MUST include at least 1 `p` tag specifying the recipient's key, chosen from the original poll event's list of keys 
  * MUST include the same primary hosting relay URL in all `p` tags as is specified in the `e` tag
* MUST include exactly 1 `poll_option` tag which references the chosen vote option by its corresponding index `n`
* MUST include a valid `ots` tag, if the original poll event specifies a `closed_at` time

```json
...
"tags": [
  ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of the original poll event>, <primary poll host relay URL>],
  ["p", <32-bytes hex of the recipient's key>, <primary poll host relay URL>],
  ["poll_option", "n"],
  ...
],
"ots": <base64-encoded OTS file data>
...
```

## Zap poll outcome

Polls results are tallied by summing the exact satoshi values from all eligible zaps for each `poll_option`. The total tally is the sum of all individual `poll_option` tallies, and `poll_option` results are calculated by their percentage of the total tally value. 

To avoid ambiguity of results, strict adherence to the following rules is vital when tallying and rendering poll outcomes.

A tallying client:
* MUST ONLY include full satoshi value amounts in option tallies from ALL eligible zaps that meet ALL following criteria: 
* MUST ONLY tally zaps that reference the original poll event by its `e` tag value
* MUST ONLY tally zaps sent to a `p` key specified in the original poll event
* MUST NOT tally zaps from the poll author's `p`
* MUST ONLY include zap amounts less than or equal to `value_maximum`, if specified
* MUST ONLY include zap amounts greater than or equal to `value_minimum`, if specified
* if both `value_maximum` and `value_minimum` are specified AND are equal:
  * MUST ONLY count 1 zap per option, per participant
* if a `closed_at` time is specified, clients:
  * MUST ONLY tally zaps including a valid `ots` tag indicating a sent time greater than or equal to the original poll event's `ots` time  
  * MUST ONLY tally zaps including a valid `ots` tag indicating a sent time less than or equal to `closed_at` time

Additionally, a tallying client:
* MUST display the distribution percentages, from the tally total, for each vote option tally
* MUST display the `consensus_threshold` (if specified) relative to the winning vote percentage
* SHOULD show tally results to all note zappers, even if they haven't voted on an option
* SHOULD publicly show results after the `closed_at` time has passed (if specified)
* MAY display the counts of zap events received for each option, along with other poll statistics

Strict adherence to these requirements should enable a standardized means of quantitatively assessing the distribution of opinion regarding a poll's content amongst poll participants, determining a winning outcome, and possibly achieving consensus. However, until this protocol is further tested, refined, and proven robust, polls should probably not be considered authoritative nor binding.
