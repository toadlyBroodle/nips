# Poll event

`draft` `optional` `author:toadlyBroodle`

A poll note is a [nostr event](01.md) (kind `6969`) for conducting paid polls. A poll presents two or more voting options, which participants my vote on by sending regular [zap events](57.md) which include an additional `poll_option` vote tag. Poll results should be blinded, until after users have voted. Polls should specify a `closed_at` time, after which results be unblinded, closed to new votes, and the tally considered final. Polls may specify either `value_maximum` or `value_minimum` satoshi valuations for determining which zaps are included in the tally. Polls may also specify a `consensus_threshold` for assessing the state of consensus.

## Purpose

The purpose of poll notes is to conduct quantitative public opinion polls over nostr by requiring voters pay to participate. By tallying results to real satoshi valuations, nostr polls intend to provide superior signal compared to other free polling models. Imposing real monetary costs for participation should also discourage undesired participants attempting to sway results.

By including a `value_maximum` limit, polls can stop single 'whale' votes discounting many smaller 'shrimp' votes. Likewise, by including a `value_minimum` limit, polls can make automated low-value vote flooding attacks prohibitively expensive. However, both limits remain optional to allow for freedom in poll design.

The optional `consensus_threshold` is intended as a simple 'measuring bar', defined as the minimum percentage for any single `poll_option`'s percentage of the total tally to attain poll consensus status.

A careful balancing of all poll attributes should enable pollers to conduct tailored polls that deliver meaningful and valuable outcomes.

## Poll format

A poll event:
* MUST specify an `e` tag that includes a primary hosting relay URL
* MUST specify a `p` tag that includes the same primary hosting relay specified in the `e` tag
* MUST contain a primary description string, specified in the `content` field
* MUST contain a `poll_options` tag, containing a serialized key-value array of vote options, formatted as below
* MUST include at least 2 voting options, each with its own unique description string
* SHOULD specify a `closed_at` time:
  * when specified, MUST include a valid [`ots` tag](03.md), proving original poll publishing time
  * a `closed_at` value of less than or equal to the `created_at` field indicates a poll SHOULD NOT be closed.
* MAY specify a `value_maximum` satoshi value for zapped votes to be included in the tally
* MAY specify a `value_minimum` satoshi value for zapped votes to be included in the tally
  * `value_minimum` MUST be less than or equal to `value_maximum`, when both are specified
* MAY include a `consensus_threshold` (0-100), representing a percentage threshold for any single vote option to achieve poll consensus
  * a `consensus_threshold` of '0' indicates no threshold is specified.

}
```

## Zap vote format

Poll options are voted on by sending [zap events](57.md) (referencing the original poll event's `e` and `p` values) that indicate their chosen vote option in a `poll_option`. To ensure all eligible votes are included in the tally, `e` and `p` tags must specify a primary hosting relay.

The zap request event (kind `9734`): 
* MUST specify an `e` tag that references the original poll event
  * MUST include a primary hosting relay URL in the `e` tag
* MUST specify a `p` tag that references the poller's pubkey
  * MUST include the same primary hosting relay URL in the `p` tag as is specified in the `e` tag
* MUST include exactly 1 `poll_option` tag
* MUST reference the vote option by its corresponding integer `n`, chosen from the original poll event's key-value array of predefined `polling_options`
* MUST include a valid `ots` tag, if the original poll event specifies a `closed_at` time

```json
...
"tags": [
  ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of the original poll event>, <primary poll host relay URL>],
  ["p", <32-bytes hex of the key>, <primary poll host relay URL>],
  ["poll_option", "n"],
  ...
],
"ots": <base64-encoded OTS file data>
...
```

## Poll outcome

Polls results are tallied by summing the exact satoshi values from all eligible zaps for each `poll_option`. The total tally is the sum of all individual `poll_option` tallies, and `poll_option` results are calculated by their percentage of the total tally value. 

To avoid ambiguity of results, strict adherence to the following rules is vital when tallying and rendering poll outcomes.

A tallying client:
* MUST clearly indicate the `value_maximum`, `value_minimum`, and `closed_at` attributes (when specified) to participants before they vote
* MUST ONLY include full satoshi value amounts in option tallies from ALL eligible zaps that meet ALL following criteria: 
* MUST ONLY tally zaps that reference the original poll event by its `e` tag value
* MUST ONLY tally zaps sent to the poller's `p` key
* MUST ONLY include zap amounts less than or equal to `value_maximum`, if specified
* MUST ONLY include zap amounts greater than or equal to `value_minimum`, if specified
* if a `closed_at` time is specified, clients:
  * MUST ONLY tally zaps including a valid `ots` tag indicating a sent time greater than or equal to the original poll event's `ots` time  
  * MUST ONLY tally zaps including a valid `ots` tag indicating a sent time less than or equal to `closed_at` time

Additionally, a tallying client:
* MUST display the distribution percentages, from the tally total, for each vote option tally
* MUST display the `consensus_threshold` (if specified) relative to the winning vote percentage
* SHOULD publicly blind results until after a user's vote has been received
* SHOULD publicly display results after the `closed_at` time has passed (if specified)
* MAY display the counts of zap events received for each option, along with other poll statistics

Strict adherence to these requirements should enable a standardized means of quantitatively assessing the distribution of opinion regarding a poll's content amongst poll participants, determining a winning outcome, and possibly achieving consensus. However, until this protocol is further tested, refined, and proven robust, polls should probably not be considered authoritative nor binding.

## TODO

* refine NIP#69 based RFC feedback
* implement polls in 2 clients
* merge with nostr-protocol/NIPs
